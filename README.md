# Cybersecurity-Journey
Progress reports on my cybersecurity learnings.



#NOVEMBER 3RD, 2025 - A NEW BEGINNING.
Tired of where life was taking me, I decided to put down the xbox controller and pick up a keyboard. 

*ACTIONS TAKEN THAT DAY* : Downloaded Oracle virtualbox, downloaded a copy of parrotOS security edition and mounted the image to virtual machine file,
installed the OS, then practiced linux commands. Ran into an issue where mkdir didn't work, utilized claudeAI to diagnosed the $PATH output message and 
concluded issue was a missing colon in the path. Fixed it temporarily with the EXPORT= command, but will need to implement a permanent fix. Started,
Google cybersecurity certificate program.
